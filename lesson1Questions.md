##Why not start with a start button as the first button or user input? We have to start the game right?

Yes! Starting the game with a start button is the logical first step.

However lets think about what it achieves.

Clicking the button implies that there is a game to start. But since this is the first button, the button doesn't actually do anything. The user cannot start the game. since the game doesn't exist yet.

Since we are trying to create the minimal viable product, we have to get closer to allowing the user to achieve their goal. Maybe beginning to have the game exist.

So we have to determine what the the most minimal amount of effort we have to do to allow the user to play the game. The game is a 3x3 grid. Each section of the grid allows for two inputs, an X and an O.

The smallest piece of the grid, it probably the input. It is the most singular, and non dependant piece. Its the most atomized part of our game. Everything relies on it. The button requires nothing, but the users input.

Whenever we start developing anything, we have to find the core pieces that don't require anything.
