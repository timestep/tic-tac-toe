# Lesson 1

## What is the course?
This course is designed to aid and guide you through the development of an application. In the end, we will have gone through Javascript/HTML/CSS concepts, code architecture, refactoring and debugging. The whole web development/ coding experience.

## Teaching Style
There are not really any course notes or reference material. This is on purpose. A lot of your development will be using google. Use it well.

The instructor will be employing the Socratic method, asking the student questions opposed to providing the solutions. Development is a creative process, and its important to begin to think in that manner.

## Student Expectations
You have or can do the full codeacadmey/code school online course.

## Objectives
At the end of this lesson, we expect the students to have been able to create basic buttons that represent user input and selections.
